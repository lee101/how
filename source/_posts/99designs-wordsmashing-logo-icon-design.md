I ran a [99designs](https://99designs.com) logo design contest one for my game [Word Smashing](http://wordsmashing.com) which was in desperate need of some design love.

What i learned:

## review early and often
The quicker your designers get review the sooner they can course correct and spent time working on what you want.


# manage the variety depth/breadth
Its good to have an idea of the amount of different concepts you would want explored and how deeply

Running design contests can be a great way to generate lots of design ideas to choose from.

Working with fewer designers helps you focus on refining the concepts you know you like.

The normal process is 4 days of reviewing designs, then you have time to pick at most 3 designers to refine their designs for 3 days.

You have the option to run the contest "blind" meaning designers can't see each others submissions which helps to ensure a lot of variation.

I didn't run a blind contest and did notice a lot of designs sharing a similar theme (a board),

The designers responded well when i added a comment noting that other themes that where not being explored (things being smashed into pieces)

I didn't have a color scheme in the design brief but the designers quickly converged on red, orange and black which i was happy with because it appears prominently in app stores.

I let the designers know that i had decided on a color scheme as soon as possible which helps the designers have one less thing to worry about.

## Contests are very cost effective
The silver contest cost 500 AUDs and i received an overwhelming 190 designs from 38designers

To pick the winner I sent a [design survey](http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/wordsmashing-word-puzzle-game-216866/poll/k8u6rf?utm_source=voting_app&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=voting) around and asked for feedback on what i thought where the best designs.

The winner was [TastyBits](https://99designs.com/profiles/1196873/about) who turned out to live in the same city as me (Melbourne)

I got a bit of feedback and despite not everyone liking my favourite (some refereed to it as a logo which "looks like a diner" which may not be wrong)
my mind was made up :)

After the design contest Word Smashing got launched on games.com and became a smashing success!

I made other games [Multiplication Master](http://multiplicationmaster.com/), [Big Multiplayer Chess](http://bigmultiplayerchess.com/) and [ReWord Game](http://rewordgame.com) in that order.

Despite the new games being much more mobile friendly than Word Smashing was when it was launched, they have struggled to achieve the same success.

Overall it was a very hands on process involving a lot my time reviewing and giving feedback, the time spent did help me discover what i really wanted.

## The global design community doesn't sleep
As with many crowdsourcing models, running a design contest you'll be working with designers all over the world working 24/7.
Work can come in at any time so remember to give review when you wake up and go to sleep.

## Think through the design and where its going to be used
i picked the design with the most detail in it but i realised afterwards it looks like a scribble at 32x32 favicon size
Be clear about where your designs are going to be used e.g. does it need to stand out on an app store? work on 3 different types of shirt?

## Be sure to ask for exactly what you want!

I didn't think to ask for a completely square version without the slight drop shadow in it or an inverted color design for a darker background

I received eps and pdf files which are a bit tricky to work with, make sure you **ask for editable source files** .psd (Photoshop) or .ai (Illustrator)

working with a designer afterwards 1 to 1 is easy but knowing as much as you can about what you want in advance will help to keep the project on track and avoid any unexpected expenses.


I will definitely run more design contests in the future.

Its a great way to explore different design ideas and find a designer who loves designing for your business.

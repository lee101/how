At [99designs](https://99designs.com) i had a great opportunity to run a design contest.

At the time I had a game [Word Smashing](http://wordsmashing.com) which was in desperate nee dof some design love. 

Word Smashing was at the time a fun word puzzle i had made to challenge myself and i didn't think of it as a viable business.




If you take a look at some of my original design ideas youll endderstand why running a design contest on 99designs was a great idea for me.

Running design contests can be a great way to generate lots of design ideas to choose from.

The silver contest cost 500 AUDs and i recieved an overwhelming 190 designs from 38designers

The winner was [TastyBits](https://99designs.com/profiles/1196873/about) who turned out to live in the same city as me (Melbourne)
After the three days of working with the winners it was time to pick a winner!
I used the handy ability send a [design survey](http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/wordsmashing-word-puzzle-game-216866/poll/k8u6rf?utm_source=voting_app&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=voting) around and ask for feedback on what i thought where the best designs.

I got a bit of feedback and despite not everyone liking my favourite (some refereed to it as a logo which "looks like a diner" which may not be wrong)
my mind was made up :)

After the design contest Word Smashing got launched on games.com a few days after i submitted it and become a smashing success!

I made other games [Multiplication Master](http://multiplicationmaster.com/), [Big Multiplayer Chess](http://bigmultiplayerchess.com/ and [ReWord Game](http://rewordgame.com) in that order.

Despite the new games being mobile friendlier than Word Smashing was when it was launched, they have struggled to achieve the same success.

I'm not sure what effect the design plays but you can definitely notice the lack of graphic design skill in my newer games

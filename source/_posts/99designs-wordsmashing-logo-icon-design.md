At [99designs](https://99designs.com) employees get to run a free design contest.

At the time I had a game [Word Smashing](http://wordsmashing.com) which was in desperate need of some design love.

Word Smashing was at the time a fun word puzzle i had made to challenge myself and i didn't think of it as a viable business.

My old DIY design.. D:

Running design contests can be a great way to generate lots of design ideas to choose from.

The normal process is 4 days of reviewing designs, then you have time to pick at most 3 designers to refine their designs for 3 days.

You have the option to run the contest "blind" meaning designers can't see each others submissions which helps to ensure a lot of variation.

I didn't run a blind contest and did notice a lot of designs sharing a similar theme (a board),

The designers responded well when i added a comment noting that other themes that where not being explored (things being smashed into pieces)

I didn't have a color scheme in the design brief but the designers quickly converged on red, orange and black which i was happy with because it appears prominently in app stores.

The silver contest cost 500 AUDs and i received an overwhelming 190 designs from 38designers

To pick the winner I used the handy ability send a [design survey](http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/wordsmashing-word-puzzle-game-216866/poll/k8u6rf?utm_source=voting_app&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=voting) around and ask for feedback on what i thought where the best designs.

The winner was [TastyBits](https://99designs.com/profiles/1196873/about) who turned out to live in the same city as me (Melbourne)

I got a bit of feedback and despite not everyone liking my favourite (some refereed to it as a logo which "looks like a diner" which may not be wrong)
my mind was made up :)

After the design contest Word Smashing got launched on games.com a few days after i submitted it and become a smashing success!

I made other games [Multiplication Master](http://multiplicationmaster.com/), [Big Multiplayer Chess](http://bigmultiplayerchess.com/ and [ReWord Game](http://rewordgame.com) in that order.

Despite the new games being much more mobile friendly than Word Smashing was when it was launched, they have struggled to achieve the same success.

Overall it was a very hands on process involving a lot my time reviewing and giving feedback, that process really helped me discover what i really want and

I will definitely run more design contests in the future.

Its a great way to explore different design ideas and find a designer who loves designing for your business.
